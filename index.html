    <p class="serif">
        In our daily life, there are many things that we should value. I've had many friendships, but I value the one
        with Tom
        most.
        Tom lost his arms in an accident when he was a child.Although he became disabled, he didn't lose his heart. He
        didn't
        drop out of school. Instead, he kept studying hard and always got good grades exams. He even learned to use his
        feet to
        play the piano. Now he plays it very well. He is often invited to play the piano at school concerts.
        I value the friendship with Tom above all else because his strong will has taught me that no matter what I'll
        do, I
        should be strong-willed and determined.
